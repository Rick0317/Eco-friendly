## Browser extension
How do we build a Chrome extension?
- The steps to create a Chrome extension
1. We create a project that consists of html, css, js, ... files that make up of our frontend and backend. 
2. We add "manifest.json" file in which we manage the configuration of our Chrome Extension. 
â†’ You can find the details about this file here [Manifest.json file](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest/){target="_blank"}
3. We now add our project as a Chrome extension by changing our setting of extensions to Developer mode,
and add our local file to our set of extensions. 
4. If we want to add it as a public service, we just follow the instruction on the website below.
