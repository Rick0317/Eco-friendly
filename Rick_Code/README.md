# Using the python library "BeautifulSoup" is the best way to extract html data I think

# I'm also using js to get the url of the webpage the user is seeing when they use our chrome extension
## For now, my problem is, 
* how should we incorporate python and js files
* how should we write the two functions using just one language
* we also need to show the performance of the user's computer

## I will have a separate repo in which I'll test my extension
